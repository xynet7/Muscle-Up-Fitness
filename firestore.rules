/**
 * This ruleset enforces a security model for the MuscleUp gym membership application.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * The security model is based on strict user ownership and administrative roles.
 * Users have complete control over their own data tree (profile, subscriptions, receipts),
 * but are completely isolated from other users' data. A separate, non-hierarchical
 * collection (`/roles_admin`) is used to manage administrator privileges, granting
 * them specific management capabilities over global and user data.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /membershipPlans/{membershipPlanId}: Publicly readable data about available gym plans.
 * - /users/{userId}: A user's root profile document.
 * - /users/{userId}/subscriptions/{subscriptionId}: A user's private subscription records.
 * - /users/{userId}/receipts/{receiptId}: A user's private payment receipts.
 * - /roles_admin/{userId}: A lookup collection where the existence of a document signifies
 *   that the user is an administrator.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - User data is segregated under a path containing their UID (`/users/{userId}`),
 *   making ownership checks fast and simple.
 * - Listing users from the top-level `/users` collection is disallowed to prevent
 *   user enumeration and protect privacy.
 * - Membership plans are public for any visitor to see, but can only be created or
 *   modified by administrators.
 * - Administrator roles are managed out-of-band (e.g., via the Firebase Console or a
 *   trusted backend server) by locking down the `/roles_admin` collection from all
 *   client-side writes. This is the most secure posture for role management.
 *
 * Denormalization for Authorization:
 * This ruleset relies on path-based authorization for all user data (e.g., `isOwner(userId)`),
 * which is the most performant method. For admin checks, it uses an efficient `exists()` call
 * to a dedicated `/roles_admin` collection, avoiding slow and costly `get()` calls on
 * user documents to check for a role field.
 *
 * Structural Segregation:
 * The data model is cleanly segregated. Public data (`membershipPlans`) is in its own
 * top-level collection, ensuring public `list` operations are safe. All private user data
 * is nested within that user's own document tree, preventing data leakage.
